 * This is an OSGi service interface for registering Restlet filters with a router or a resource.

 * Filters are registered with a router provider. If a router provider is not found for the
 * filter, the filter will be cached until the router provider is registered. If your filters are
 * not being registered, check there is not a typo in the alias in both the filter provider and
 * application provider.
